## Project 1: Investing Netfilx Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
### Project Description
In this project, you’ll apply the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

You’ll also gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This will allow you to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data. Press play to begin!
### Project Task 1
1. Loading your friend's data into a dictionary
2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
3. A visual inspection of our data
4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV
5. Filtering for movies!
6. Creating a scatter plot
7. Digging deeper
8. Marking non-feature films
9. Plotting with color!
10. What next?

### Project Task 2
Data visualization is often a great way to start exploring your data and uncovering insights. In this notebook, you will initiate this process by creating an informative plot of the episode data provided to you. In doing so, you're going to work on several different variables, including the episode number, the viewership, the fan rating, and guest appearances. Here are the requirements needed to pass this project:

1. Create a matplotlib scatter plot of the data that contains the following attributes:

* Each episode's episode number plotted along the x-axis
* Each episode's viewership (in millions) plotted along the y-axis
* A color scheme reflecting the scaled ratings (not the regular ratings) of each episode, such that:
    * Ratings < 0.25 are colored "red"
    * Ratings >= 0.25 and < 0.50 are colored "orange"
    * Ratings >= 0.50 and < 0.75 are colored "lightgreen"
    * Ratings >= 0.75 are colored "darkgreen"
* A sizing system, such that episodes with guest appearances have a marker size of 250 and episodes without are sized 25
* A title, reading "Popularity, Quality, and Guest Appearances on the Office"
* An x-axis label reading "Episode Number"
* A y-axis label reading "Viewership (Millions)"

2. Provide the name of one of the guest stars (hint, there were multiple!) who was in the most watched Office episode. Save it as a string in the variable top_star (e.g. top_star = "Will Ferrell").

**Important!**

To test your matplotlib plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot fig object, which you can do using the code fig = plt.figure() (provided you have imported matplotlib.pyplot as plt). In addition, in order to test it correctly, please make sure to specify your plot (including the type, data, labels, etc) in the same cell as the one you initialize your figure (fig)! You are still free to use other cells to load data, experiment, and answer Question 2.

In addition, if you want to be able to see a larger version of your plot, you can set the figure size parameters using this code (provided again you have imported matplotlib.pyplot as plt):

plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [11, 7]

**Bonus Step!**

Although it was not taught in Intermediate Python, a useful skill for visualizing different data points is to use a different marker. You can learn more about them via the Matplotlib documentation or via our course Introduction to Data Visualization with Matplotlib. Thus, as a bonus step, try to differentiate guest appearances not just with size, but also with a star!

All other attributes still apply (data on the axes, color scheme, sizes for guest appearances, title, and axis labels).
